description: A converter for ingesting .xye files generated specifically from the 11-BM beamline instrument for powder diffraction. # Any string

convert_arguments:                  # These are the arguments for the convert method
- name: sample_id                   # each argument has a name (must be a valid python key)
  desc: ID of sample measured       # and a description (any string)
  type: String                      # this is the type of the argument (see below)
  required: true                    # and whether or not the argument is required

- name: chemical_formula
  desc: formula of sample being measured
  type: String
  required: true

- name: temperature_kelvin
  desc: measurement temperature
  type: String
  required: true

## Valid types:
# String
# Integer
# Real
# List[n][t], where n is the number of elements in the list and t is the corresponding primitive type
# e.g. List[3][Real] is a vector of length three
# e.g. List[2][String] is a list of two strings
